# ENGR7761-Computer-Vision

Repositry for my KLT dart tracker implmented using Python OpenCV.
## Project motivation
The purpose of the project was to investigate how the trajectory of a dart could be estimated and plotted using computer vision with the Lucas-Kanade (LK) method.

This was then further extended to use Shi-Tomasi corner detection as feature identification for the LK algorithm.

## Layout

The processing code is located in the Jupyter notebook. The data to feed into the program is located inside the repo with its respective names.
